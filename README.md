### Intro
Hi, I'm Milo Chan. milo1004 is just my name in my team. I am Tech Enthusiast who loves to code and the world of Operating Systems. 
My first coding language learnt, is Scratch. And that's why my profile pic is Scratch. 
But now, of course, I need to step forward and have an upgrade. I learnt Python, and it is also my favourite coding language.
